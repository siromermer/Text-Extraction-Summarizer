<h1> Main Project : https://github.com/siromermer/Text-Extractor-Summarizer-Translator-MobileApp</h1>
Important : <br>
- I didnt spend many time for this tkinter GUI . For main project please go to the link in the above . Actually first i wrote this GUI and i convert it to the flutter app . You can use that flutter app in Desktop as well as mobile . <BR>
- I suggest you to use flutter app version whether you are using   desktop or not(flutter can be used in desktop without problem just like any GUI) . I didnt spend any time for this GUIs design , therefore it is not that arranged<br>
<br>
- If you decide to use this tkinter GUI , i suggest you to read  https://github.com/siromermer/Text-Extractor-Summarizer-Translator-MobileApp .readme file ,i explained how things works . <br><br>
- I strongly recommend flutter version it is more clear and fast .
